# MUJ_HACKS2.0
Project Submission. AGRI-CARE
This is a project made for the hackathon held on 13-01-2019. 
The problem statement we chose was Agriculture.
The product was AGRI-CARE.

ABOUT THE PRODUCT:

We know the current scenario and from all the data, statistics and the constant news publications that come across us of some or the other farmer committing suicide or someone dying because of some or the other reason. We are here to offer a solution to this. The idea of our project has been inspired from some of the saddening facts like every year Rs. 58,000 Crore and 40% of the annual produce is being spent in waste. So the idea is that we would set up a Customer Care portal through which the farmers can directly contact us and tell us about the surplus or the unsold crops and produces they have with them. We would analyse the situation and send people from a nearby storage facility and buy the produce at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and get them back to the storage facility and arrange for a proper and safe storage. From there on our vision can take place which is that the government would setup kind of an affordale canteens /mess in which the food served would be from the same produce that we had bought from the farmers. This would mean that anyone from any background or economic condition can have the best quality of food at the most affordale and easiest way. These canteens would be setup strategically at places where the people from economically weaker section can easily access and enjoy the relishes that the canteen serves them which is nothing but just the pure love of the farmers working on the crops and of those who were provided employement in this noblest of noble cause.

BENEFITS:
-Large scope of Employement
-Drastic drop in farmer deaths and deaths caused by unavailable food.
-We save Rs. 58,000 Crore worth of money which could be invested in setting up these Canteens all through the country.
-Nobody would ever again in our country die because of unavilibility of food or employement.
